# Atlas

**A personal knowledge and skill-development vault.**

This is my long-term enviroment for learning, building, and focusing on what I care about.
It will evolve, and that’s the point.

## Focus

Primary tracks (i'll try not to stretch myself):

* Cybersecurity
* Systems & low-level programming
* Networking

Secondary (kept lean, project-driven):

* Game development & graphics
* Mathematics for CS
* Linux & tooling

Everything else = hobby lane only.

## How this vault is used

* Atomic notes (one idea per note)
* Heavy use of linking & tags
* Diagrams + handwritten pages (XP-Pen)
* Projects > passive notes

## Structure (initial)

* `/00_inbox` — raw, messy capture
* `/01_foundations` — fundamentals (math, CS, networking)
* `/02_cybersecurity` — labs, writeups, exploits
* `/03_programming` — languages, systems, patterns
* `/04_projects` — real work
* `/05_research` — deep dives & papers
* `/99_archive` — old / completed / irrelevant

## Rules

1. No copy-paste junk.
2. Every concept must be linked to *at least one* other note.
3. If I can’t explain it, I don’t understand it.
4. Build something with everything I learn.

## Goal

Become **employable** in my main fields within the next 2 years.
