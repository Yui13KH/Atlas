# Atlas

**A personal knowledge and skill-development vault.**

This is my long-term environment for learning, building, and focusing on what I care about.
It will evolve, and that’s the point.

To be honest i am probably just too ambitious and like the plan is too unrealistic to actually follow , Handwritten notes ? seriously that would take forever its a waste of time ( or maybe it isn't I don't know ) I'll keep it like this for now and see what happens later 
## Structure (initial)

* `/00_inbox` — raw, messy capture
* `/01_tech` — anything tech related
* `/02_science` — science related (STEM)
* `/03_language` — Human languages
* `/04_projects` — application of stuff i learned ( tho its hard to keep it relevant cause i might be applying what I learned in the normal notes)
* `/05_journal` — Personal Notes , random thoughts , random planning 
* `/99_archive` — old / completed / irrelevant

## Rules

1. No copy-paste junk.
2. Every concept must be linked to *at least one* other note.
3. If I can’t explain it, I don’t understand it.
4. Build something with everything I learn.

## Goal

Become **employable** in my main fields within the next 2 years.
