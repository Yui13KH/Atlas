## Week 6 – Troubleshooting 
### What troubleshooting really is

- **Troubleshooting** = figuring out what’s broken and fixing it _systematically_.
    
- First rule: **ask questions**.
    
- Second rule: **don’t make the user feel dumb**. Ever.

### The basic troubleshooting flow 

1. **Ask questions**
    
    - What happened?
        
    - When did it start?
        
    - What changed?
        
2. **Isolate the problem**
    
    - Shrink the scope until only one thing can be wrong.
        
    - Stop chasing symptoms.
        
3. **Find the root cause**
    
    - One main problem usually causes multiple small ones.
        
4. **Follow the evidence**
    
    - Logs.
        
    - Error messages (start from the _first_ error).
        
5. **Try the fastest thing first**
    
    - Reboot, reconnect, retry — if it’s quick, do it.

### Common mistakes to avoid

- **Autopilot mode**
    
    - Same issue ≠ same cause.
        
    - Small changes matter.
        
- **Fixing symptoms**
    
    - Don’t patch 10 small problems instead of fixing the real one.

### Customer service

- Acknowledge the user.
    
- Be patient.
    
- Be honest, even if the answer sucks.
    
- Break steps into simple chunks.
    
- People are stressed — don’t take it personally.

### A good IT interaction looks like this

1. First impression matters (be human, be professional).
    
2. Actually listen.
    
3. Clarify the issue _before_ touching anything.
    
4. End positively:
    
    - What was fixed
        
    - What happens next
        
    - Any questions?

### Documentation

- If it’s not written down, it didn’t happen.
    
- **Tickets** track issues.
    
- **Bugs** = system problems, not user-caused.
    
- Common tools: Jira, Bugzilla, Redmine (names only, don’t care).
    

Good documentation:

- What was broken
    
- What caused it
    
- What you tried
    
- What fixed it
    

Keep it:

- Short
    
- Technical
    
- Clear  
    Not a story. No personality.

### Interviews

- You don’t need all answers — you need **clear thinking**.
    
- Be ready to explain basics (DNS, DHCP, OS, networking).
    
- Ask clarifying questions — that’s expected.
    
- Have an **elevator pitch** ready:
    
    - Who you are
        
    - What you’re into
        
    - Where you want to go

### One-line takeaway

Troubleshooting is asking good questions, narrowing the problem, following evidence, and not panicking — while treating people like humans.
