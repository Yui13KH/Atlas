# Notes on C++ Basics – January 06, 2026

### Core Concepts (from learncpp.com refresh)

- A **computer program** is a sequence of instructions that tell the computer what to do.
- A **statement** is a type of instruction that causes the program to *perform some action*.
- A **function** is a collection of statements that get executed sequentially (in order, from top to bottom).
- Every C++ program must have a special function named **main** (all lowercase letters).
- In programming, the name of a function (or object, type, template, etc.) is called its **identifier**.
- A **character** is a written symbol or mark, such as a letter, digit, punctuation mark, or mathematical symbol.
- A sequence of characters is called **text** (also called a **string** in programming contexts).

### Preprocessor & main Function

- `#include <x>` is a special line called a **preprocessor directive**. It tells the program that we want to use the content of `x` in our program.
- `int main()` is telling the compiler to define a function whose identifier is called **main** (which is required in any C++ program) that produces/returns a value of type `int` (integer).
- You have to define what type of data you're returning from a function in C++ (or not returning anything with `void`), but you have to specify it anyway.
