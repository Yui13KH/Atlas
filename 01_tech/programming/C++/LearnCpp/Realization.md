### Why I'm Doing This

So like I was just looking online at videos and interview questions and all of that, and I realized that I actually aren't that good in C++—sure I know the basics but nothing too deep: pointers, references, ptrs/move/lambdas etc I don't know.

Sooooooo I am going through this website (learncpp.com) to learn all about those, and I'll take notes on everything I think is important to memorize and remember, since I am also doing graphics programming which relies heavily on C++, so knowing this is beneficial to me.

And I mean C++ is an amazing language. **Let's'a go!**
