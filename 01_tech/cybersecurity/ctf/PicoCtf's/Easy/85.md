First Grep (picoCTF)

The challenge provides a large text file containing mostly irrelevant data. Since picoCTF flags follow a known format, pattern matching was used to locate and extract the flag efficiently instead of manually reviewing the file.

Approach:
Searched the file for strings matching the picoCTF{...} format and extracted the matching substring.

Commands used:
grep
