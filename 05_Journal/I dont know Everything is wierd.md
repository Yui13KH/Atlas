## 2026-01-02

Yay, new year, new goals, as they say. But honestly, nothing is really working out. Everything feels fucked. At best, the job market is shit. Now you need at least a CS degree and some years of experience, and the whole “I’m self-taught” thing doesn’t really work anymore. Maybe with networking, a good GitHub, and enough visibility it could work, but I don’t know. Do we really need to become YouTubers just to show people what we can do?

I guess there’s no other way: work on a good project and document the progress, like dev logs but for software. But that needs planning and an actual software development cycle. I mean, sure, I have Coursera+ and I’m doing the courses, but apparently, according to everything online, “yeah, they’re good for information, but they’re not respected.”

Honestly, the Google IT cert might’ve landed you a job back when it first launched, before COVID, back in 2018. But hi, it’s 2025. Everything is different now. Don’t even dream about an IT job without at least A+, and maybe Network+, and even then, good luck finding a job.

Am I just blaming things I don’t control to make myself feel better? Like, “oh yeah, it’s not my fault, everything is fucked”? Maybe. Maybe not. I don’t know at this point. To be honest, I think I’m doing quite well on my side — it’s just that life has been very shitty to me.

Dropping out of high school, taking care of my grandfather for about two years, now I’m 20 without a diploma. Online schooling is slow as fuck. I’ll probably get the diploma at 21, and even then with low grades. Honestly, redoing a GED might be better, I don’t know.

And we haven’t even gotten into the worst part: being a foreigner in Turkey, especially being Syrian. I fully understand the Turkish perspective, and honestly, they’re right about many points. There are just too many Syrians here. A lot of them are uneducated. I’m not trying to shit on Syrians — it’s just how it is. Many are short-tempered. The population saturation isn’t even spread equally; it’s concentrated in like 5–7 districts instead of being balanced.

Syrians working illegally because employers are pieces of shit hurts Syrians and Turks alike. Now everyone wants to pay lower than minimum wage. Sure, Syria got “freed” and some Syrians are going back, so you’d think “oh, surely now there are jobs,” but nah. Maybe illegal jobs, lol. Or farming or construction — physically destroying your body or working 12 hours for less than minimum wage.

And here I am like, “I don’t want to work blue-collar jobs.” No disrespect — I respect those people a lot. Their jobs suck, but they still do them. I really tried to get a job as a cashier, storage worker, whatever, but nope: you’re Syrian.

At this point, going back to Syria might honestly be more efficient, but even there it’s still fucked according to my friends.

I spent God knows how long learning C++, C#.NET, ADO.NET, MS SQL, just to realize they’re barely used here. You need Node.js and TypeScript instead. Fine, switching stacks isn’t hard. But people with CS degrees and years of experience can’t find jobs — so how am I supposed to?

“Don’t be pessimistic, try anyway.” Yeah, I am trying. That’s the whole point. I’m still going, but everything feels hopeless, like a waste of time.

On top of that, I like too many things: graphics programming, cybersecurity, IT, backend, simulations, data analytics. But then you realize you’re spreading yourself too thin and never getting good enough at one thing to be employable. That’s probably true. I should focus on one path until I land a job, and only then branch out.

Cybersecurity and graphics programming aren’t entry-level anyway. Graphics programming is built different — you probably need to be at “can build your own engine” level to be employable. It’s cool, math-heavy, and painful, but you’re not getting a job in it without years of experience.

Backend roles exist, but remote is insanely competitive. Locally, I’ll just keep getting hit with “you’re Syrian, you don’t have Turkish ID.” The worst part is living here for 11 years, since kindergarten, and still feeling unwelcome no matter how assimilated you are. Nobody cares if your Turkish is C1.

The government handled this in such a weird way — mass citizenship just to shift votes. In my own family, some have citizenship and some don’t. It makes zero sense.

It feels like shit knowing you can’t do anything about your current situation. I guess all I can do is keep learning and building.

I was thinking about OSSU since I basically have infinite time. High school is just 9th-grade exams because of COVID and skipping a year — easy but slow and annoying.

Worst part is, even if I learn everything, get certs, somehow get money, I still get hit with the “you’re Syrian” wall. Same with bookkeeping — many jobs don’t even require a finance degree, it’s basically data entry, but I still get rejected.

I even passed all stages for Istanbul 42 back in 2023, and I’m still stuck in the last stage because foreigner quotas are “limited.” Just say you don’t want Syrians upfront instead of wasting two months of my time.

At this point, I honestly don’t know what to do anymore.

### Current plan:

- Study backend with Node.js and TypeScript
    
- Build a realistic project, following real dev practices
    
- Network and talk about it — maybe it works, who knows
    

And let’s not even get into AI shit.

So yeah, the plan is:

- Get high school diploma
    
- Focus on backend dev until I land a job somehow
    
- Get into shape and improve flexibility
    
- Learn German (Germany is close, even if moving there as a Syrian is doubtful — still useful locally)
    
- Learn university-level math for knowledge (Khan Academy STEM)
    
- Do OSSU, since a degree without income is impossible anyway
    

Maybe also look into data analytics and ML since it’s hot. Do CS50AI — nothing to lose.

Boot.dev was nice, but I can’t afford it. Even if it’s cheap, it’s not respected anyway. The networking aspect is the only real benefit. Same thing with Odin Project backend (Ruby on Rails). Rails is still alive, but mostly maintenance, and probably mid-level only.

Graphics programming stays a hobby. It improves math, physics, optimization. Maybe build a simple simulation or even a tiny engine someday.

If backend never works out, maybe do frontend too and become full-stack. I don’t even know anymore. It’s just annoying and boring.

AI hype will probably slow down, or just create bad code that needs fixing. I think Stanford showed that many AI-based projects fail.

It’s 3am. I should sleep.
