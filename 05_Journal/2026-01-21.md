So, the exam results for Açık Lise were announced, and yay, I sucked at most of them. Well, I did study for some, and I did pass those — I got 90 in chemistry and 80 in biology. But Turkish literature, bro… 20–30. Damn, I got cooked on those.

Anyway, the point is: it was bad, but it’s mainly Turkish literature that I need to work on. Realistically, everything else is manageable because it’s either memorization or stuff like that. And if you think I got 90 in chemistry or 80 in biology because I actually studied for them diligently, you’d be very wrong. I had family issues and only about three weeks before the exams. I pretty much kind of cheated the system: I fetched old questions and made a sort of “graph” of the most asked question types, then worked on those.

I just want the diploma — I’m just being honest here. So let’s do the same for Turkish literature, because I’m not learning literature in Turkish. I don’t even know it properly in English; imagine in Turkish. Even my Turkish friends used to struggle with literature.
