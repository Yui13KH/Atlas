Bro, I really am scattered.

My main focus was *supposedly* cybersecurity. I was doing Coursera courses, thinking maybe I’d do A+ and Security+ after, get that mini diploma thing they have. Even if it’s not super valuable, the knowledge is.

Then I just… gave up on it. Now I’m into graphics programming and quant. Like lol, what happened to cybersecurity? Did I already give up on it or what?

My problem is that the things I’m interested in are:

- cybersecurity  
- graphics programming  
- quantitative development  

These are **multiple-years-per-profession** paths. You don’t get into any of them anymore with shallow knowledge.

They *might* be linked in non-obvious ways. All of them need strong analytical thinking and problem-solving. In all of them, you need a deep understanding of computers and how they work.  
Cyber and quant both need deep understanding of architecture and networking.  
Graphics programming and quant dev need very high-level math to become proficient.

But the main idea stays the same: they are **very unrelated fields**, and each one is its own rabbit hole.

If you’re chasing money, quant dev is probably the highest.  
Cyber is probably easier to find a job in, maybe blue teaming if you get Security+ and then learn through TryHackMe / Hack The Box, maybe their certs.  
Graphics programming is so niche you probably can’t even find a job unless you network hard — or do the Tokyo Spliff way: show your work publicly until someone reaches out.

But yeah, you really need to focus on **one path**. You can’t possibly learn all of them together. I’m being way too ambitious.

Like that first README thing with handwritten notes — duh, you don’t want to spend 6 months reading one book just because you’re handwriting notes. Handwriting is great for STEM and problem-solving, or when you’re designing solutions. But for programming theory, handwritten notes are not that useful and drop your speed by like 10×.

Anyway, I’m a mess right now.

Current plan:  
Just brush up on C in case École 42 accepts me. One of them said if you’ve done CS50 (which I did), then you know most of the curriculum; only some shell stuff is new.

So I’m doing that, and also learning C++ in depth. Apparently I don’t actually know the language deeply. I tried solving questions and realized there’s a lot of stuff I know how to *use* but not how it *works* — big difference.

So yeah, I found this huge book list (like 34 books) from Coding Jesus. I ordered them from simplest to hardest. I’ll go through them and write notes somewhere (my folder management is a mess). Probably topic-based folders, not one folder per book.

I also have this weird focus issue where I fall asleep without controlling it. I don’t think it’s narcolepsy. And I’m not going to be like “haha I have ADHD” — I’m not diagnosed, and lack of focus doesn’t automatically mean ADHD.

From what I found, it might be a bad habit linked to a garbage school life (from kindergarten to high school). Long story short: I used sleep as an escape. I even learned lucid dreaming at one point. Cool at first, then it became a curse. Reality blended with fiction, and you just want to sleep 24/7 because life sucks.

I don’t want to self-diagnose depression or suicidal thoughts, but I definitely wasn’t mentally stable back then.

So now my brain associates studying environments with that past and shuts down as a safety mechanism. Some kind of trauma-induced neurological response, maybe.

It got stupid. Even in exams I knew I’d ace, I’d fall asleep or feel nauseous, like passing out. It spread to daily life: buses, conversations I find boring, sitting still.

I found weird workarounds:
- staying physically active
- reading while walking
- rewriting text (Monkeytype-style)
- TTS + reading along
- following text with a pen or finger

Anything interactive works. Silent reading sometimes shuts me down.

The weird part: once I learn something, it sticks **really well**. I still remember enzyme diagrams and notes from 9th grade.

Anyway… yeah. Enough yapping.
