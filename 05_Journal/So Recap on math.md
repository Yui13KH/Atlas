Sure! Here's your text with the grammar fixed, keeping all your original wording intact:

Basically, I checked the brochure of the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, and their admissions are quite forgiving as long as you pass a math test and have graduated from high school. Anyway, I checked it and realized that my math level isn’t at all on par with it. Sure, I remember some high school math like algebra, trig, statistics, geometry—all that—but calculus, derivatives, not really. So, I edited my too ambitious book list to learn math, and, well, the first book is Stewart on Precalculus (good luck for me, it’s 1060 pages), though that’s like about 3 months, I believe. So yeah, let’s do it. I’ll have a Xournal++ file in the math folder under science, because writing LaTeX is nice and all, and it does work in Obsidian.

$$  
a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}  
$$

Even more advanced stuff:

$$  
i\hbar \dfrac{\partial }{\partial t}-\Psi =\widehat{H}\Psi  
$$

The nice thing is that it doesn’t really matter how long or not long it is—it will work even inline:

Like this: $\widehat{f}\left( \xi \right) =\int ^{\infty }_{-\infty }f\left( x\right) \cdot e^{-i2\times \pi \xi x}dx,\forall \xi \in \mathbb{R}$. See? It’s cool.

So yeah, but writing this is not cool, and I am not into research to do this, so I’ll just write my solutions and what I learned in that Xournal file like a notebook.
