Just maybe,  
but you should be prepared in all cases if it happens.

École 42  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_\(school\))

It’s a long story, but in 2023/2024 I applied and got rejected due to policies or whatever, because I’m a foreigner. I passed all the tests and reached the final interview stage, then they basically said, “well, you can’t really come to the actual campus.” Probably some Turkish law or something—I don’t know the exact details.

So randomly, I thought about emailing them again just to check if anything had changed. Apparently, it’s kind of vague—_very_ vague—but they said, and I quote:

> _"Our policy was updated in 2025, and foreign applicants who met certain conditions became eligible to register.  
> We will be announcing the Piscine dates for 2026 soon. We recommend registering for a Piscine if it fits your schedule and then reviewing the registration email. The registration email will include detailed information about the requirements."_

So yeah, it’s vague, but they’re not straight-up saying, “nope, sorry, we can’t accept foreigners.” Back in 2024, I also sent an email (can’t find it now, probably deleted it), and they responded with something like, “sadly, we can’t accept any foreigners unless you have a Turkish ID.” So this response is clearly different.

Anyway, back to my point: they themselves don’t have their curriculum publicly available, but with a bit of searching you can find other students sharing the curriculum and projects on GitHub. So you can easily get a general idea of what they teach and how things go.

So I thought: until they open their Piscines, I might as well refresh my C. I already learned a bit of it in CS50x, so reviewing makes sense. C is the primary language they teach, then C++, which I’m already doing, and probably some shell—commands and maybe bash scripting.

My main source would be _“The ANSI C Programming Language”_ by Ritchie and Kernighan. Yeah, I know it’s an old book (1988), but everyone recommends it and it’s very highly respected, at least from what I found online. It’s not for beginners; it’s for people who already know programming and want to learn C specifically. I think I know enough programming concepts to read it, and if there’s something I don’t get, I can just look it up.

I don’t know why, but I always like to be prepared just in case. If it happens and you’re overprepared, the program doesn’t have strict time limits, and you’d be very useful to others in team-based projects. So yeah—let’s do it.
