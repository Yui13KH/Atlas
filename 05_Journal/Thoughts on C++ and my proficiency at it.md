# Self Journal Entry – January 06, 2026

**NOTE**: Okay, so I looked back on my cpp-learning-journey GitHub repo  
<https://github.com/Yui13KH/cpp-learning-journey>  
and even though I forgot quite a lot (this was like 1 year ago), I was just browsing through it and realized I actually know a lot more C++ than I thought I did.

I'll still go through learncpp as a refresher—it doesn't hurt—but I might skim it kinda, because I don't just know quite a good amount of C++; I asked some other people (who are supposedly seniors) and they said I would actually easily be employable as a junior dev, heck maybe even a mid dev with some training.

Soooo, I don't know, I feel like I'm bragging now. Maybe I also have a tendency to be a bit perfectionist—like I must know everything or at least 90%, or I feel like I'm unqualified—but maybe that's a me-problem. I'll go through learncpp anyway, both to learn anything I don't know and to refresh the things I do know.

Since all of this was both inspired by me doing graphics programming + me kinda getting interested in quant dev, I'll probably read some books and write notes (like idk, I'll search for golden standards in topics related to those).

### Thoughts on the Current State of the Industry
Also, one thing I noticed just by watching online people doing interviews—and I don't want to diss on anyone—but this generation is kinda cooked.  
People graduating from CS not knowing CS fundamentals, worse—people working as software developers not knowing what they are doing or how it works, just heavy reliance on AI.

Like damn, they said AI is either going to take our jobs or just make us better, but lol it didn't take the jobs but made us worse. Sure it's nice as a quick search engine (that sometimes is confidently wrong)—it's made to just spit out whatever you would like to hear, like "wow that's amazing, bro you are way past proficient etc."  

Like me for example, I pasted some of my GitHub repo list and it was like  
*"This is a professional-grade portfolio that a mid-level C++ developer would be proud of."*  
Like sure bro thanks for the compliment, but yeah.

I guess now there will be a no-AI community thing where people never use AI cuz it kinda more likely to fuck up your skills rather than help you.

### The Opportunity
The opportunity—with a cooked generation that relies on AI and can't think for themselves + attention spans that are so short people can't read 1 page without dazing off—now is probably respect to people with actual deep understanding is highly needed.

I mean I checked and I saw that CVEs skyrocketed from 2024-2025; before that 2021-2023 there was a steady slow increase, but 2024-2025 it just went up way too much. I wonder why (cough cough Copilot).

Seriously, I believe it's just people relying on AI way too much without having any understanding of what they are shipping. A quick research says 41% of all code in 2025 was AI-generated—yeah good luck with understanding + tracking + if your project becomes 30-50 files+ the AI would be like "yeah nope bro."

And even when that isn't the case, it's just bad. It almost never does what you want it to do (it may give you the result you want but not do it the way you want it to do it)—two different things. It can maybe pass the tests but does it follow the constraints? Maybe CPU usage, maybe RAM usage, is it optimal or fastest, does it use the correct data structures etc.?

I mean AI is kinda an average model thing, and the average code on GitHub is probably garbage, so you input garbage you get out garbage :D

### Moving Forward
Anyway, point is, I believe that now these days (after companies really realize that they fucked up by making their software be mostly AI-generated + firing a lot of their employees), then anyone with deep understanding of subjects—idk in tech stuff like OS's, networking, architecture, stuff like that—would be very highly needed.

So I'll work on myself for now.

Getting a job is like 90% requiring you to have a CS degree, which I don't have, so good luck me finding a job at all. I probably need to save up and maybe do an online bachelor's in CS and then get an internship at like 3rd year of uni.
