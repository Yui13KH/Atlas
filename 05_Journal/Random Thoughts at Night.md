Hi, it's like 3am literally and I don’t know what is happening with me. I am trying to be ambitious and be like, "Yeah, I'll learn what I need to learn." Things worth doing are hard in life and all that, but at the same time I’m like, "What am I actually supposed to do?"  

I thought having a background in C++ that was supposedly good would make things easier, but now I am unsure about every decision I make. Should I skim LearnCpp or read everything in detail? Would I be wasting my time relearning the basics, or is it a good refresher? I have no idea.  

The problem even extends to books. For example, I am now into quant development (I know I’m into so many things at once—I should really focus on one), but I don’t know. There is this person, Programming Jesus, and people have opinions on him, but I think he’s very knowledgeable about the stuff he talks about. Even if he comes across as harsh sometimes, he’s just being realistic about the job market and other things.  

Anyway, he has a book recommendation list on Amazon, organized from basics to advanced. I thought, "Yeah, let’s just read all of them." But that’s like a 2–3 year plan—there are 35 books if we assume I read one a month and fully understand it. That might be doable, depending on length and technicality. Three years on paper is fine—I’m 20. If you’re at a pro level in these things by 23, heck even 25, you’re in a rare category of expertise that most people aren’t willing to work for. Even people who go to uni for CS often aren’t there.  

But then I think, "Do I really need to read all of them? Maybe I already know some of it." That’s probably true, but even if I know everything, I’d probably fail the stupidest questions in some topics. Or maybe I’m just stressed, being pulled in different directions, trying my luck in too many areas without focusing. Like, I want to be in graphics programming—its own niche and specialized field. Same with quant development.  

The best question I keep asking myself—not from pessimism—is: if I do all of this, am I actually going to earn anything, or will I just be cast out because I’m a foreigner and don’t belong where I’m geographically located? I’m not trying to be dramatic… or maybe I am, but I bet nobody is going to read these journals anyway. That’s not really the goal.  

Right now, we’re just waiting to see what will happen with Ecole 42 when they open, and whether I’ll be accepted. They said "under certain conditions," which might be impossible to meet, but I can try to stay somewhat positive.  

For now, I think just going through LearnCpp completely without skipping is probably a good idea to learn C++ at a somewhat deep level. We’ll see what happens later—you never know what life will throw at you.
