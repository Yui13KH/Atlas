## Week 1 – IT Basics

### What IT actually is

IT is just using computers, networks, and software to solve problems for people.  
That’s it. No need to overthink it.

---

### IT support

IT support people install, maintain, configure, and fix computers and systems when they break.  
Not my goal, but good background.

## Core concepts I actually need

### What a computer is

A computer is a machine that processes data by doing calculations.

---

### Algorithms

An algorithm is a step-by-step way to solve a problem.  
Already familiar from programming, nothing new here.

---

### Binary (important)

- Computers use binary (0 and 1)
    
- 0 = off, 1 = on
    
- 8 bits = 1 byte
    
- 1 byte = 256 values (0–255)
    

Binary is the base of everything: memory, IPs, permissions, encoding, networking.

---

### Character encoding

Computers store text as numbers.

- ASCII was the early standard
    
- UTF-8 / Unicode is the modern standard (supports all languages)
    

This matters for things like weird characters, web stuff, and security bugs.

---

### Logic gates 

Logic gates combine 0s and 1s to make decisions.  
I don’t need the electronics details right now, just the idea.

---

### Abstraction

Abstraction = hiding complexity so humans can work with systems more easily.

This explains why:

- software doesn’t talk directly to hardware
    
- systems are layered
    
- security issues happen when layers trust each other too much
    

---

### Computer layers

1. Hardware
    
2. Operating System
    
3. Software
    
4. User
    

Cybersecurity often involves abusing or breaking assumptions between these layers.

---

### Cryptography (for now)

Cryptography = protecting information using math.  
Details come later with practice.

---

### Open source

Open source means the code is available to read, modify, and share.  
Important because most security tools and exploits are open source.

---

### Stuff I can safely ignore

- Keyboard history
    
- Abacus
    
- IT pioneers
    
- Punch cards
    
- Motivational IT talk
    

Interesting, but not useful for what I’m doing.

---

### One-line takeaway

Computers use binary to process data, systems are layered through abstraction, and most security problems happen when those layers break or trust each other too much.
